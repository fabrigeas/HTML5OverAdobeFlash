## Abstract

For several years the dominant technology for displaying moving images (videos and animations) in websites was the use of Adobe Flash, 
however Adobe Flash has become increasingly criticized and discredited in the recent years due to the its instability and its susceptibility to attacks, 
this to the point that the company Adobe decided to shut down its Adobe Flash Platform by 2020. 

The new standards of the W3C (Wide Web Consortium) i.e. HTML5 offers new features including elements that facilitate the display of moving im-ages on webpages. 
HTML5 is now replacing Adobe Flash as the dominant method for the task of displaying moving images in webpages. 

This thesis will demonstrate the possibili-ties that HTML5 offers for displaying moving images as well as the limitation when com-pared to other technologies precisely Adobe Flash.
